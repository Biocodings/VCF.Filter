# VCF.Filter
Graphically filter VCF files on custom annotations. Java 1.8 application. Filter and prioritize genomic sequence variants reported in VCF files.


The source code is part of a NetBeans project. 

To build VCF.Filter from the source, we suggest using NetBeans Integrated Development Environment software https://netbeans.org/.

In NetBeans, go to Team -> Remote -> Clone and use 

https://github.com/hmueller80/VCF.Filter.git

as the URL. 

After cloning has finished, instruct NetBeans to build a project from the source. 

You should now be able to build VCF.Filter by right-clicking the VCF.Filter project root folder (called VCFFilter) in your project tree and click Build.

NetBeans projects may also be imported into Eclipse, although we haven't tested building VCF.Filter in Eclipse.
